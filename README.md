Hello,
This project was created to make some practice while I am studying and preparing some classes for my students!
Follow some information about the project, probably it will help you to make the configuration.



-IDE- Intelij/ Eclipse / Visual Code
-Spring Initialzr
    -Dependencies(
    MAVEN
    JAVA 17
    MONGO DB- NO SQL
    LOMBOK
    SPRING BOOT WEB
    SPRING BOOT DEV TOOLS
    )
- API - Simple API movies

-MVN Repository- To find out more dependencies that could help the project

**** Also I suggest that you look for "Spring dotenv - me.paulschwarz " dependency, to make the security information about data base.****


OBS: After included new dependencies remember to reload the project, it will avoid some projectÂ´s problem.
If you decided to change the database, remember to make the correct configuration and
include/change de dependency, otherwise it will not connect correctly.

ATTENTION
PROBLEMS COULD HAPPEN : JAVA VERSION - IDE VERSION - DATA BASE VERSION
